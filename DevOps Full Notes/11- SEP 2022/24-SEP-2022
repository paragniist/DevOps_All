Jinja2 Templates
While working with Ansible in implementing software configuration automation, as part of software installations we might need to generate configuration files pertaining to the env on which we are deploying the application. we can take the help of jinja2 templates in generating the configuration files during the playbook execution.
	
Jinja2 engine has provided coding constructs / instruction set in generating the dynamic configuration files by embedding conditional statements and loops within the template files

#1. variables substitutions
{{variableName}} variable expression to substitute with a value

#2. conditional statements in generating the dynamic output
2.1 
if condition:-
	
{%if var operator value %}
  statements
{% endif %}
	
	
2.1 if-else condition:-
{%if var operator value %}
	statements
{%else%}
	statements
{%endif%}

2.2 if/elif/else/endif condition:-
	
{%if var operator value1%}
  statements
{% elif var operator value2 %}
  statements
{% else %}
	statements
{% endif %}

Loop control statements
{% for var in values %}
	statements
{% endfor %}
