2.2 File Module
The File module is used for creating a new file/folder or changing the permissions of an existing file/folder or removing 

#1. create a new file
- name: task
  file:
    path: 
    state: touch
		
#2. create a new directory
- name: task
  file:
    path: 
    state: directory

#3. how to create a symlink file to an existing file
We create symlink pointing to the existing file/directory on the Filesystem. there are 2 types of symlinks are there 
1. softlink
2. hardlink

- name: task
  file:
    src: sourcefilelocation
		dest: symlnkfileNameWithlocation
		owner: 
    group:
    state: link | hard
Note: for softlink the owner and group is not applicable, only for the hardlinks it is applicable

#4. How to change the owner and group of an existing file
- name: task
  file:
    path:
    group:
    owner:
    mode:

#5. How to preserve the modificationTime and accessTime of a file?
Linux will not keep track of the information about creation time of a file or directory. but it keeps track of 3 timestamps related to a file/directory
1. accessedTime = read/copy/move operations on the file/folder, the accessed time will be changed
2. modifiedTime = modify the contents of the file then modified time will be changed
3. changeTime = when we change the attributes of the file like group, owner and permissions then changeTime will be affected

- name: task
  file:
   path:
   group:
   owner:
   mode:
   modification_time: preserve
	 access_time: preserve
	 
the possibles values we can write for access_time and modification_time is : now or preserve or set to custom date and tie format '{{%Y%m%d%H%M.%S}}'

2.3 lineinfile module
if we wanted to edit or change a single line in an existing file we can use lineinfile module. we can treat it as something similar to sed in linux

#1 replace a line based on matching expression
/etc/mysql/mysqld.cnf
MYSQL_BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
	
sed -i 's/^MYSQL_BIND_ADDRESS=.*/MYSQL_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0/g'	/etc/mysql/mysqld.conf

syntax:
lineinfile:
  path: locationOfTheFile
	regexp:
	line:

- name: task
  lineinfile:
		path: /etc/mysql/mysqld.cnf
		regexp: '^MYSQL_BIND_ADDRESS=.*'
		line: 'MYSQL_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0'
			
#2. how to add/remove a line before or after the matching expression line
/etc/ssh/sshd_conf
PermitEmptyPassword no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no

we want to add a new line after PermitEmptyPassword line with line text: PasswordAuthentication yes
expected output:
/etc/ssh/sshd_conf
PermitEmptyPassword no
PasswordAuthentication yes
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no

- name: task
  lineinfile:
		path: /etc/sshd/sshd_conf
		line: 'PasswordAuthentication yes'
		insertAfter: '^PermitEmptyPasswords.*'
