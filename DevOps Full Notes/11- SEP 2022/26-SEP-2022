Playbook execution strategies
By default Ansible runs each tasks within the playbook on all the hosts listed in the inventory before moving to the next task. If we want to change this default behaviour, we can use different strategies


#1 Selecting Strategy
The default strategy of executing a playbook is linear (one by one), ansible offers other strategies 
1. linear
2. free
3. debug

you can set a strategy to be applied either at the playbook level or global at ansible.cfg

playbook.yml
- name: play
	hosts: group
	strategy: free

(or)
		
ansible.cfg
[default]
strategy=free
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Number of Forks
if we have processing power and want to use more forks in executing the playbook tasks we modify the forks in ansible.cfg
[default]
forks=19

How to achieve rolling update (or zero-downtime patching)
There are keywords using which we can apply the execution strategies
serial: number
indicating the playbook should be applied for how many machines in batches

for eg.. if we specify serial: 3 means the playbook will be applied on 3 machines within fleet and there after moves to the next 3 months

serial can take either  a number or percentage
serial = 3 = batch of 3 machines at once
serial = 20% = out of the number of hosts/servers on inventory, it counts the percentage of machines and applies in batches. for eg.. if we have 10 machines a 20% of the 10 is 2 will be applied

order:
The order keyword controls the order in which the playbooks are applied on the hosts
order:
inventory
reverse_inventory
sorted
reverse_sorted
shuffle
