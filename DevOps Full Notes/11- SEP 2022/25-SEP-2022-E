ansible roles
ansible roles are used for packaging and distributing the ansible playbook automations in a standardized way, so that people can reuse them quickly aspart of their playbook automations.
	
To help others to easily use an code automation, ansible has defined 8 standard directories into which we can organize the files required for applying the automation

rootdir (role) (apache2webhosting)
|-default
	|-main.yml
|-files
|-templates
|-tasks
	|-main.yml
|-handlers
	|-main.yml
|-meta
	|-main.yml
|-vars
	|-main.yml
|-tests
	|-inventory
	|-main.yml

1. default/main.yml = variables with default values are configured, we can override these default values during playbook execution
2. files = static files that are used aspart of automation
3. templates = jinja2 template files
4. tasks/main.yml = tasks to be executed aspart of the role

main.yml
- import_tasks: install-jdk11.yml
- import_tasks: create-tomcatuser.yml
- import_tasks: setup-tomcat10.yml
- import_tasks: create-tomcat-service.yml

5. handlers/main.yml = place all the handlers that has to be executed upon executing an task of the role when notified
6. meta/main.yml = define the metadata information about the role like author, licensing, platform, version etc
7. vars/main.yml = variable declarations used aspart of role
8. tests = contains required files for testing the role


How to create a role?
ansible has provided an tool called ansible-galaxy using which we can create a role directory layout quickly
ansible-galaxy init rolename

How to use a role inside a playbook?
we need to place the roles inside any of the 3 standard directories to be used inside a playbook
1. roles/ directory under the playbook directory
2. /etc/ansible/roles
3. roles_path in ansible.cfg pointing to a directory where we want to place the roles


playbook.yml
- name: play
	hosts: all
	roles:
	- roleName
