What is cloud?
Cloud is on-demand delivery of computing resources to the world

Hosting: To make an software application accessible to the public world, we need to host the application. hosting is the process of perform required activities like
1. procuring the infrastructure
		1. compute machine
		2. networking devices
		3. internet lines
		etc
2. installing & configuring the software libraries/applications required in running the application
to make the application accessible to the enduser.
	
How to host an application?
There are multiple ways we can host an application

#1. In-House hosting
In-house hosting is the process where an organization or individual procure all the resources in hosting and making the application accessible to the world
1. real-estate or place where we can install the physical resources like computers/network devices
2. procure hardware resources like
	1. computers
	2. network devices
	3. routers
	4. firewalls
	etc
3. leased internet lines
4. 24/7 powerback
5. aircooled environment
6. man power: administrators, network engineers, security specialists and support/maintainance engineers

From the above we can understand there are lot of challenges involved in self-hosting an application like
1. huge investment 
2. time required for initial setup and running the systems is very high
3. huge maintainance cost in managing the hardware and even man power

looks like In-housing is suitable for large-enterprise organizations who needs dedicated hardware resources for data privacy and security like banking & financial organizations uses In-house hosting, but not suitable for everyone
