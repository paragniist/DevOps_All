write an playbook that creates an user 'joe'	with home directory, password and enable passwordless sudoers access

1. we need to create the user with home directory, password = user module
2. /etc/sudoers                = lineinfile
we need to add an entry 
joe ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

adduser-playbook.yml
---
- name: adduser play
	hosts: all

	- name: add user joe
		user:
			name: joe
