How to build information and distribute to the world?
To distribute the information, we need to build the information and hold it. In a computer we can create a file and store the data/information to distribute.
	
By keeping information in a text file and distributing it may not be effective in reaching to the large crowd of audience, because a text of content cannot be read and understand by everyone.
	
To present information in an formatted manner by using colors, fonts, tables, images, video and audio tools etc the w3c organization has introduced HTML Language

HTML stands for Hypertext markup language, the HTML language has been introduced by Internet Standard organization (W3C Organization). using HTML Language we create HTML Pages which are also called "WebPages".
The HTML language has provided lot of pre-defined tags using we create web pages to render information/data to the user in a formatted manner. 
How does an HTML page looks like, what is the basic structure of an HTML Page?
every HTML page is written with an extension ".html" only and has predefined tags written inside them

home.html	
----------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<HTML>
	<HEAD>
		<TITLE>Home page</TITLE>
	</HEAD>
	<BODY>
		<H2>HOME PAGE</H2>
		<P>

	</BODY>
</HTML>
	
To access and view the contents of the page in formatted manner, we need HTML tools called Web Browsers. Browsers are specialized softwares, they know how to read the contents of HTML page parse the tags and render the information in a presentable format

So the business organization or an entity has to create a website containing multiple HTML or web pages describing the information about their business and distribute them over the internet.
				
These web applications can be classified into 2 types:
1. static web application
A static web application contains web pages or html pages which always displays the same information/contents to the enduser. 

2. dynamic web application
A dynamic web application allows the users to interact with application by passing data as an input, the application performs operation using the user data and returns the response.
The dynamic applications requires an backend programming language to develop like
1. java
2. .net
3. php
4. python
5. ruby
