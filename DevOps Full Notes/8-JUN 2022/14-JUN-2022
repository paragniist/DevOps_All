How to host an static web application?
	
To host an static web application we need 
httpd servers: they can receive http request, look for the resource in a webroot directory and send the HTML Page or a Web Page as response back to the client.
	
There are lot of opensource httpd servers	are manufactured and distributed by different vendors, few of the popular distributions are
1. nginx
2. apache2 httpd server
	
http client: A web browser acts as an client program in sending http request to the server and receives the HTML Response from the server and render it on the page

An web application can be hosted in 2 ways 
1. through intra-network (within the organization) (LAN/WAN network)
2. over the internet and making it accessible to the public world.
