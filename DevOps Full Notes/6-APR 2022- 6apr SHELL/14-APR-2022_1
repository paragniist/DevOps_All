Control Statements
------------------
Control statements are used for controlling the flow of execution of a program. By default a program is executed from top to bottom sequentially.  If we want to change the flow of execution of the program then we need to use Control Statements.
	
There are 2 types of control statements are there
1. conditional control statements
2. loop control statements

#1. Conditional Control Statements
Based on the outcome of an conditional/relational expression we will decide a specific block of code to be executed or not using Conditional Control Statements. There are 2 types of Conditional control statements are there
	1.1 IF-FI
	1.2 CASE
	
1.1 IF Statement
IF statement is used for evaluating an relational expression, and based on the truthness of the expression we execute a block of code.
Syntax:-
	IF [ RELATIONALEXPRESSION ]
	THEN
		#STATEMENTS
	FI
	
There are other variants of IF condition are available to write the code in much optimized way.
1.1 IF-ELSE-FI Statement

Wap to find biggest of 2 numbers?
	
bigNumber.sh
-------------
#!/bin/bash
A=$1
B=$2

if [ $A -gt $B ] 
then
	echo "$A is big"
fi

if [ $B -gt $A ] # this if condition evaluation is waste when $A is already big
then
	echo "$B is big"
fi

./bigNumber.sh 20 10
In the above program we wrote 2 if conditions to find which of the 2 given numbers are big. when we find one of it is big, there is no need of checking for other way as we have only 2 inputs. But here we are checking 2nd if condition also even though A is declared as big to find whether B is big are not

instead of writing 2 if statements we can use if-else statement as below.
	
	
bigNumber.sh
-------------
#Assumption the user will not input both numbers as same
#!/bin/bash
A=$1
B=$2

if [ $A -gt $B ]
then 
	echo "$A is big"
else
	echo "$B is big"
fi

#2 wap to calculate taxable amount based on gross salary of an employee
gross amount: 100000
gender: male   = 15% (tax) = 15000
	      female = 12% (tax) = 12000
	
male: ga * 15 / 100
female: ga * 12 / 100
	
taxableamount.sh
-----------------
#!/bin/bash
read -p "gross income:" GROSS_INCOME
read -p "gender:" GENDER
TAX_AMOUNT=0

if [ $GENDER == "male" ]
then
	TAX_AMOUNT=$[(GROSS_INCOME*15)/100]
else
	TAX_AMOUNT=$[(GROSS_INCOME*12)/100]
fi
echo "gross income: $GROSS_INCOME and tax amount to be paid: $TAX_AMOUNT"
