nano
nano is not shipped by default within all the linux distros, but in ubuntu distro nano is available along with vim/vi editor

unlike vim/vi being a programmers editor, nano provides simple command that can be used by a general user in editing the text files quickly and save it.
	
how to work with nano?
nano filename 
if it is an existing file, then nano opens the file for editing other wise creates a blank file for writin the content.
	
ctrl + o =writes the unsaved changes onto the file
ctrl + x = quit = when we press ctrl+x with unsaved changes it ask for confirmation to save or not (y/n).
ctrl + w = search for a word in the file
ctrl + \ = to replace a text pharse with a different
prompts for searching for a phrase: input phrase and press enter
prompts for replacing phrase: input replacement phrase
then prompts replace each instance one after the other or all at once

ctrl + k = cut the line
ctrl + u = paste line
ctrl + c = displays line number, character in the file
ctrl + underscore(_) = jump to a specific line in the file

packaging and compressing
-------------------------
#1. packaging

We have some files on the filesystem of our computer and we want to share or transfer these files to an another user, what are the possibilities in transferring files?
	1. we can copy the file into a storage device and can take it to another computer
	2. send over an email
	3. transfer it over the network using sftp, ftp etc
	
lets say we have bunch of files we would want to send it over the network or through an email, inorder to send these bunch of files we need to transfer one after the another file

since it takes lot of time to transfer each file at a time, we can group all the files into a folder, but the folders are not transferable, in such case how can we transfer bunch files together quickly

That is where packaging comes into picture, packaging is a technic of combining multiple files into one single file. The packging doesnt really compress the size of the original file rather it just bundles multiple files into one single file only.
	
The linx has provided an utility called tar which is used for packging and unpacking the files.

#1. how to package the files?	
tar -cvf pics.tar pics/
tar -cvf pic.tar pics/1.jpg pics/2.jpg

	
tar stands for tape archive used for packaging bunch of files into a single file with an extension .tar, the above command will packages the contents of pics/ directory into a pics.tar file
here 
-c = create
-v = verbose
-f = filename to be created

#2. unpack the contents of a tar file
tar -xvf picks.tar
the above command extracts the content of the tar file pics.tar 
-x = extract
-v = verbose
-f = filename to be extracted

#3. how to see the contents inside a tar file
tar -tvf filename.tar
without extracting it just displays the contents inside the tar file
