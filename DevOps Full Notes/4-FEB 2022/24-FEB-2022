The Root user of the linux operating system can promote any other normal user as a sudoer. The sudoer can perform operations onbehalf of the Root user

Root user vs Sudoer
sudoer can act like an root user but can be restricted in many ways by the Root, but a Root user is an ultimate user who has full access to the entire linux machine

How to promote an normal user as a sudoer?
There are 2 ways are there
1. make entry into /etc/sudoers file
2. create an sudoers file with user entry under /etc/sudoers.d

#1. /etc/sudoers file
There are 2 ways we can promote users as sudoers.
1.1 user level
we can promote an individual user as a sudoer by making an entry in sudoers section
/etc/sudoers
username ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

1.2 group level
we can promote a specific group of users to act as sudoers using
%group ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

1st ALL = can execute sudo commands from any remote host
2nd ALL = can execute sudo commands on all the users
3rd ALL = can execute sudo commands on any group
4th ALL = any commands can be executed on any group of users as above
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#2. /etc/sudoers.d
instead of adding an user/group entry into /etc/sudoers file we can very well promote an user as a sudoer by creating an file under /etc/sudoers.d for each user or group

it is easy to add or remove users or groups as sudoers by creating/deleting the files rather than editing existing file

For eg. if we want to promote user "tom" as sudoer in 2nd approach
1. create a file with filename as "tom" under /etc/sudoers.d
2. add the tom user entry into the /etc/sudoers.d/tom file to grant sudo access as defined below
tom ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

this will makes the user "tom" as sudoer, if we dont want "tom" as sudoer simply delete the tom file under /etc/sudoers.d

note: it is recommended to create files under /etc/sudoers.d with filename as username because it would be easy to keep track of which users are promoted as sudoers quickly

similar to individual user we can promote group of users also as sudoers by creating an file under /etc/sudoers.d with groupName
for eg if we want to promote devopsgroup users as sudoers then we can create an file
1. create a file with name devopsgroup under /etc/sudoers.d
2. then add the group entry into /etc/sudoers.d/devopsgroup
%devopsgroup ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
with the above all the devopsgroup users becomes suoders.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While modifying the sudoers file we should be very careful, if in case if we have written sudoers entry wrongly/syntactical mistake , then all the users of the linux operating system will looose sudoers access

In such case how can we validate the changes we made in sudoers file before apply?
*** Follow the below process before applying the changes we made in sudoers file:
1. copy the contents of the sudoers file into /tmp directory
cp /etc/sudoers /tmp
2. make the changes into the /tmp/sudoers file
3. validate the changes we made are correct or wrong in /tmp/sudoers using
visudo -cf /tmp/sudoers
parsed ok
4. copy the tmp file replacing the original file under /etc/sudoers

-c = check
-f = file to be checked
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in case if we modify the sudoers file with a syntax mistake then everyone will loose sudoers access then how to fix the sudoers error?
There is a command called pkexec visudo /etc/sudoers
then it prompts for root/super user password and allows you to edit the sudoers file

pkexec = is used for executing any command as another user, if username is not specified then the given program/command will be exeucted as an administrater super user or root

pk stands for polkit


sudo = executing a command onbehalf root only
pkexec = executing any linux command onbehalf any user (even you are not sudoer)
