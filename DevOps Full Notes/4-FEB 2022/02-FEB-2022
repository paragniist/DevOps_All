1. head
if we want to only see the contents of a file from beginging of few lines then we can use head shell command.
	
head filename = by default shows top 10 lines of the file irrespective of how big the file is
head -n filename = we can use -n option for display specified number of lines from the top of the file
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. tail
if we want to see the lines from the bottom of the file we can use tail
tail filename = by default displays the bottom 10 lines of a file
tail -n filename = displays the specified -n lines from the bottom of the file

tails is mostly used for viewing the log files that are generated by an program

what is log file?
Log file is used for tracing the flow of execution of a program. The program during its execution will emits intermediate output and writes to an log files along with errors it encoutered during execution, such information can be used by technical team to analyze the program execution and errors to strengthen the program or debug failures

How to see the log file generated by the program?
tail -f logFile
here -f stands for follow along with the output generated into the file.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to compare the contents of 2 different files?
There are 2 bash shell commands available for comparing the contents of 2 files.
	1. cmp
	2. diff
	
1. cmp
-------
cmp stands for "compare" which will compare 2 files byte by byte and outputs the first different between their file contents
For eg let us create 2 files places.txt and popularplaces.txt with below contents

cat > places.txt
hyderabad
chennai
mumbai
delhi

cat > popularplaces.txt
hyderabad
pune
mumbai
goa

#1 by default behaviour: 
cmp places.txt popularplaces.txt
it compares the 2 inputs files and displays the first byte difference between the 2 files as below.
	
output:-
places.txt popularplaces.txt differ: byte 11, line 2
	
#2 if both files are same:
if both the files are identical it doesnt show any output.
	
options that are available in cmp command
-------------------------------------------
1. -b = along with displaying the difference byte position, it displays differing character as well along 

2. -i = skip number of bytes in both the files to start comparision.
cmp -i 15 places.txt popularplaces.txt

the compare command skips 15 bytes from both the files and start comparing the contents.
	
3. -i n1:n2 = skip n1 number of bytes from first file and n2 numbers of bytes from 2nd file and compare

4. -l = list down all the byte differents in both the files
cmp -l file1.txt file2.txt
byteposition  bytevaluefile1  bytevaluefile2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#2. diff
diff stands for difference. unlike cmp the diff command compares line by line contents of 2 files and displays the output.
	
The most important thing about this command is along with showing the differents it will display special symbols helping us to identify what changes has to be done to makes these 2 files identical.
	
Special symbols:
1. a = add 
2. c = change 
3. d = delete 

It displays special symbols indicating what actions to be performed on file1 to make it identical with file2

places.txt
-----------
hyderabad
chennai
banglore
pune
mumbai

popularplaces.txt
------------------
hyderabad
chennai
culcutta
banglore
pune
mumbai

diff places.txt popularplaces.txt
2a3
>culcutta
1. line number in first file
2. operation
3. line number pointing to second file

in addition with special characters it shows hints with < and > symbols indicate:
< = what contents of the file1 should be changed
> = with which contents of the file2

for eg..
#1	
3a4
> chennai
-----
after 3rd line in file1 add 4 line of file 2 where 4th line of file 2 is chennai

#2 
4,5c4,5
< banana
< oranges
----------
> grapes
> apples
change the 4,5 the lines of file1 with contents of 4,5 th line of the file2
where file1 4, 5 line is banana and oranges should be replaced with 4, 5 th lines of file2 grapes and apples


#3
3d2
< mathew
---------
delete the 3rd line in file1 which is mathew so that from 2nd line onwards both the files contents are same



2a3 means:
add after 2nd line in first file the contents of 3 line of file2


places.txt
-----------
hyderabad
chennai
banglore
pune
mumbai

popularplaces.txt
------------------
hyderabad
chennai
banglore
mumbai

4d3 = delete 4th line from file1 so that both the files will syncup from line 3
	

places.txt
-----------
hyderabad
chennai
banglore
pune
mumbai

------------------
hyderabad
