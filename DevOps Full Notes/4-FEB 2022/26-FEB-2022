What is the difference between sudoers and pkexec?
We can delegate/grant the root access to any other linux user through sudoers, now the normal users can act like root using sudo or by switching to root user using sudo su -
	
The pkexec command can be used for executing any linux command onbehalf the Root using super user credentials, which means only an super user can execute pkexec command.

How to enforce restrictions on the sudoers?
In sudoers we can use alias for enforcing restrictions on the sudoers, there are four types of alias are supported
1. User_Alias
2. Runas_Alias
3. Host_Alias
4. Cmnd_Alias

#4. Cmnd_Alias
we can grant an sudoer to execute a specific list of commands under sudo/root permission by using Cmnd_Alias

#Cmnd_Alias
Cmnd_Alias USER_MGMT_CMNDS=/sbin/useradd,/sbin/usermod,/sbin/groupadd,/sbin/chmod,/sbin/chown

#Users 
joe ALL=(ALL:ALL) USER_MGMT_CMNDS

#3. Host_Alias
we can grant an sudoer to execute commands under sudo/root permissions if the user has been connected through a specific hostname of the computer
#Host Alias
Host_Alias REMOTE_HOST=192.168.1.4
joe REMOTE_HOST=(ALL:ALL) ALL

if joe has been logged into to the machine using the above ip address, then only he is permitted to execute the commands under sudo/root

#1. User_Alias
----------------
we can specify a set of users to grab sudo/root access through the help of User_Alias

User_Alias DEVOPS_ADMINS=kerin,bob,joe,jim
DEVOPS_ADMINS ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
all the 4 users kerin, bob, joe and jim can act as sudoers
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to configure passwordless sudo access?
by default linux will prompt the user to enter his password while executing a command using sudo just for the sake of additional security

we can disable this additional check by using NOPASSWD variable in sudoers file as below
/etc/sudoers
username ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
Now the user can execute sudo commands without prompting for/reentering password
