1. What are the regular expressions that are allowed to be used as apart of shell commands?
There are 3 symbols are supported:
1. * = match any number of characters of any characters
2. ? = match with single characters of any 
3. [] = match with single character within a give group of given characters in []

2. What are ranges, what is the purpose of?
if we want to repeatedly execute the shell command over a range of values then we can use ranges. ranges are denoted with {lower..higher}
touch a{1..10}.txt

3. How to create an hidden file/folder in linux?
if we create a file/folder starts with "." linux by default consider it as hidden file/folder only, and these files/folders would not appear with ls command.

we need to use ls -a to see hidden files/folders within a directory

4. What is more what is the purpose of it?
if a shell command results into a larger output we can scroll through the output using more
for eg..
cat filename | more
ls -l | more

The more by default displays the content that fits to a page allowing us to scroll by pressing ENTER key and if we want quit we need to press q

working with head and tail commands

1. head
--------
we can see the data stored inside a file using cat command, if the file is too big and when we use cat command it leaves us to the last line of the file showing us only few lines at the end.
but we are interested to see the top few lines of data within the file, which can be done through using head

head = is also used for seeing the data inside the file, but we can limit the number of lines we want to see from the top

head filename = by default displays the top 10 lines of the file
head -n filename = it shows the n number of lines from the top

head -20 story.txt = shows top 20 lines in the file.

2. tail
---------
tail is used for seeing the data inside the file from the end/bottom of the file
tail filename = by default tail displays only the last 10 lines of the file.
if we want to see a specific number of lines from bottom of the file we can use

tail -n filename = only specified n number of lines from the bottom will be displayed.

The real purpose of tail is used for seeing the log files generated by an application and quite useful command being used in production and during application debugging.

What is a log file, what is the purpose of it?
Log files are used for tracing the flow of execution of a program. We can record or can track the program execution by writing the intermediate output of the program in a log file.

In case of any errors or failures of the program we can find them and debug them by looking into the log files generated by the program.
The contents of the log file will be appended while the program is executing.
We can see the generated log output of a program by using tail command.

The typical extensions with which the log files are stored are:
1. .log
2. .out
3. .err
4. .debug

#1 type gedit oddnumbers.sh and write the below lines
/home/sriman:$
oddnumbers.sh
-----------
I=1
while [ $I -lt 200 ]
do
	echo "I : $I" >> ~/oddnumbers.log
	I=$[I+2]
	sleep 2s	
done

#2 chmod u+x oddnumbers.sh = gave execute permission to run the program
#3 run the program
./oddnumbers.sh

How to see the generated log output of a program under execution?
tail can be used for viewing/seeing the generated log output of a program using

tail -f logFileName
here -f stands for flow and the command will not terminate after displaying the last 10 lines rather it streams through the output generated by the program into the file


tail -nf logFileName
if we want to see the last n number of lines rather than only 10 lines and wanted to stream over the file for further output use -nf

press ctrl+c to stop streaming or flowing
