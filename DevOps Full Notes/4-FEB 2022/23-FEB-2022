sudoers
----------

There is only one Root user exists in the linux operating system to retain the control of the system/resources with only one user. as it is impossible to manage with only one root user in the reality the linux has introduced sudoers

who are sudoers, what can they do?
sudoers are the users who can perform the operations onbehalf of the Root user, which means they can act like root user
but there is a difference between root user and sudoers, the root user while making an user as a sudoer can enfore restrictions on the user

How to make a normal user as a sudoer?
There are 2 ways:
1. by using /etc/sudoers file
2. by creating an sudoers entry under the directory /etc/sudoers.d


#1. working with /etc/sudoers file
Root can promote an normal linux user as a sudoer by making an entry of the user into /etc/sudoers file.
	
There are 2 sections are there in sudoers file
#1. user section
#2 group section

we can either promote an individual user as a sudoer or we can promote a group so that all the users belongs to that group can become suoders

#1.1 user section
For each individual user whom we want to promote as a sudoer should be added an entry into /etc/sudoers file under user section as shown below
username ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

1st ALL = The user can grab sudo access from any remote location
2nd ALL = user can perform sudo operations onbehalf of any user
3rd ALL = user can perform sudo operations onbehalf of any group
4th ALL = user can execute any bash commands by using sudo

#1.2 group section
instead of promoting individual users as a sudoers we can manage a group of users easily by adding the group to the sudoers file

For eg.. 
we want to promote all the people working in operations department to be promoted as sudoers, rather than adding every user in sudoers file, we can bind all the users to a group like "devopsgroup" and declare the group under sudoers file as below.
	
%groupName ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
here % indicates that it is a group name rather than username


what sudoers can do?
1. by default an user will launch the shell as a normal user only, so all the shell commands he executes will be applied/executed onbehalf the user only
2. if the normal user has been promoted as a sudoers then 
	2.1 he can execute any shell command using sudo 
	"sudo" means execute the shell command as a root user
	2.2 he can even switch to the root user as well by using
	sudo su - or sudo su
	2.3 he can even switch to any other users of the linux by using
	sudo su username and execute shell commands onbehalf of the user
given the root allows all the above operations for that user in sudoers file

by default sudoers file is readonly, and even root user by himself cannot edit/modify sudoers file
sudo ls -l /etc/sudoers
-r--r----- 1 root root 755 Feb  3  2020 /etc/sudoers

so inorder to modify the sudoers file let us give write permission to root user as below.
sudo chmod 640 /etc/sudoers

ls -l /etc/sudoers
-rw-r----- 1 root root 755 Feb  3  2020 /etc/sudoers
