How can we write terraform configuration file with resource/datasource delcarations to provision the infrastructure?
per each project for deployment and delivery we provision the infrastructure, so there are 2 ways we place the infrastructure and configuration management code
1. along with the application project
2. by keeping them in a separate repository with a project something like project-integration or project-cicd directory


main.tf
--------
terraform {
	required_providers {
		aws {
			source = "hashicorp/aws"
		}
	}
}

provider "aws" {
	region = "ap-south-1"
	profile = default
}

resource "aws_instance" "javaec2" {
	instance_type = "t2.micro"
	ami = "ami-3938"
}
here the ec2 instance will be provisioned on default vpc, subnet & securitygroup with no keypair attached to it.
How to execute the terraform configuration?
1. goto the project directory
2. terraform init = validates the configuration by combining into one single file & downloads the provider plugin and stores in the .terraform directory under the project
3. terraform plan = dry run
4. terraform apply
