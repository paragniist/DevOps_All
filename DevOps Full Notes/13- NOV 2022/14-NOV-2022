Terraform state management
---------------------------
When we provision the infrastructure using terraform, it should use some mechanism to identify for each resource declaration what is the corresponding service/resource it has provisioned on the cloud platform, so that in subsequent re-apply of the same terraform configuration it will not re-create the resources.
	
In case if we have modified the terraform configuration from the previous run, it can identify the changes and can perform necessary actions to bring the system to the desired state.
	
Terraform uses the terraform state file to identify for a resource declaration what is the corresponding service or resource being created on the cloud provider. During the time of provisioning the infrastructure using terraform it generates an terraform.tfstate file under the project directory in which it stores the information about for which resource declaration what resources are provisioned on the cloud provider by storing resource ids being generated by the cloud provider. This is called Terraform resource mapping
