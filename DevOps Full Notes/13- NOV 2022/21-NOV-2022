Artifactory Servers
The Artifactory servers are used for 2 purposes
1. The artifactory server is majorly used for adopting ci/cd pipleline integration & delivery. The developer upon merging the feature marking as completion, we want to release the feature for qa for testing and futher stages of delivery aswell.
	
In order to release the code to the qa we take the help of continous integration tools like jenkins. The Jenkins continous integration pipeline takes care of 
1. building the project	
2. executing the junit testcases written by the developer
3. execute even the integration-tests
4. code coverage and code quality checks are passed then it produces an build artifact of the project
5. then the build artifact will be published into artifactory repository
6. then it promotes/deployes the published artifact into qa env
once the qa has certified the published build artifact, it will be promoted for further stages of delivery all the way through production

2. The artifactory repositories are nothing but remote repositories that are setup in an organization to cache and distribute the dependencies/plugins within the organization


There are many 3rd party vendors manufactured distributed artifactory server softwares in the market, few are commercial and others are opensource like
1. nexus repository (commercial)
2. jfrog repository (commercial)
JFrog Platform has provided rich set of features aspart of it
1. dependency management through various types of repositories
	1.1 maven central, bitnami repository or jcentral repositories (proxy repositories)
	1.2 docker repository or container registries
	1.3 release management pipelines 
	1.4 security scanner
	1.5 distribute and release management

3. jfrog oss repository (opensource software stack) (opensource) (community edition)
