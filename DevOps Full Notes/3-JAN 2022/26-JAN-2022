questions:-
1. How to know in which shell we are in?

How to interact with the kernal of the linux operating system?
We need an Shell interpreter program that help us in easily working with kernal.
There are 2 popular shells are available
1. bourne shell
	1.1 bourne shell (sh)
	1.2 korn shell (ksh)
	1.3 bourne again shell (bash)
	1.4 posix (sh)
	
2. c shell
	2.1 c shell (csh)
	2.2 TENEX shell (tcsh)

We terminal to interact with operating system. by default when we open terminal we will be logged into (sh) bourne shell prompt. we can switch between the shells using the shell-shortcuts.
bourne: sh ($)
bourne again shell: bash (user@computer:$)
korn shell: ksh ($)
	
When we switch from one shell to another, to return back to previous shell we need to type: exit

File Management 
----------------
What is File?
File is an logical memory unit within the harddisk of our computer in which we can store the data.
Every file has to be created using a name which is called "filename", by referring we can access the contents of the File.
	
What is Folder/Directory?
Folder or a directory is used for grouping or collecting related set of files, so that we can locate and access the files easily.

during the time of installing the linux operating system we created an user, is called "root" user of the linux. by default linux for each user creates an home directory location under which the files/folders of the user are kept.
The linux FileSystem will starts with "/"	and for each user it creates an directory under /home/$USER
For eg.. if we create an user with name "bob", then linux operating system creates an home directory for bob user under "/home/bob", similar if we create "james" user, it creates an home directory for james as well under "/home/james".
	
So every user will have access to the Files/Folders that are there in his home directory only	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When we launch the terminal window you will be by default logged into bash shell under $HOME/Desktop folder.
note:- switch to home directory of the user to work with always	by using "cd"
