How many types of Shell Interpreters are there
There are 2 popular Shell Interpreters are there
1. Bourne Shell
	1.1 Bourne Shell (sh)
	1.2 Korn Shell (ksh)
	1.3 Bourne Again Shell (bash)
	1.4 POSIX (sh)
	
2. C Shell
	2.1 C Shell (csh)
	2.2 TENEX (tcsh)
----------------------------------------------------------------
By default when we launch terminal we will be into bash, if we want to switch to a different shell we need to use shell name: sh, ksh, bash, csh etc
How do we know in which shell we are in?
echo $0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bash command structure
-----------------------
There are 3 parts in the bash command
1. command
2. options (optional)
3. arguments 
	
structure:-	
command [options] [arguments]
here options is optional to be passed

command = we want to execute
for eg.. ls is command which will shows the list of files/folders within the present working directory

options:-
options are always passed using -option/switch which is used for changing the behaviour of the command

for eg..
	ls = all the files/folders horizontally
	ls -l = here when we use -l option the ls command will show files/folders as a long listing
	ls -R = displays recursively all the files/folders, it is also changing the behaviour of the command
if we dont supply the options the default behaviour of the command works!
	
arguments:-
arguments are the inputs to the command on whom the command should be executed/performed and is even optional in few commands

for eg..
	ls = shows all the files/folders of present working directory
	ls tastebuds = now ls will take tastebuds directory as input and shows files/folders inside the tastebuds directory. 
	
while passing options as an input we need to use "-", to distinguish between argument and an option, where always the first part is command only

ls
#5 How to know what are the files and what are the directories are there in pwd?
ls -l = shows long list of files and folders by displaying their types as well
#6 How to see the files/folders that are there in cricket directory in the above directory structure given we are under $USERHOME

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#1. How to create directory?
mkdir directoryName

#2. How to create a directory inside another directory?
For eg..
we are in 
/home/sriman
	|-market
There is already a directory called market under /home/sriman. inside the market we want to create wholesale directory?
There are 2 options we have
1. change into market and create directory
cd market
mkdir wholesale

2. mkdir market/wholesale 
here we told along with directory name path/location where it has to be created
mkdir x (pwd)
mkdir x/y (create y inside x directory)
	
3. how to create parent/subdirectories along with the path
mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3 = now all the directories specified will be created
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Consider below directory structure
/home/sriman:$
|-movies
	|-english
	|-hindi
given you are in /home/sriman, create an directories/empty file inside hindi directory with name archives.txt
1. create the directories
mkdir -p movies/hindi
mkdir  movies/english
touch movies/hindi/archives.txt

always "/" at the begining of the path indicates "/" root of the FileSystem, if we want to execute the command under current directory dont use "/"
	
2. How to create an empty file?
touch filename
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#3. how to remove/delete an existing file?
/home/sriman:$
	|-store.txt
rm store.txt
rm stands for remove and is used for removing / deleting an existing file from the filesystem.
	
we can pass multiple arguments as an input to any command by using space as a separator	
for example we want to delete 3 files sports.txt stores.txt news.txt instead of rm executing 3 times with 3 input files names. we can pass all the 3 files as input at one shot
rm sports.txt stores.txt news.txt

#5 How to remove a file forcibily?
rm -f filename
There are few files that are considered as special and when we use rm filename the linux operating ask for confirmation do you want to delete y/n?
if we dont want linux to ask for confirmation and delete it forcebily then we can use -f switch.

#6 How to delete a folder/directory?
There are 2 ways we can delete a directory
#1
rmdir directoryName
rmdir deletes the directory given the directory is empty, if the directory is not empty first we need to delete all the subdirectories and files inside it and then delete the directory

for eg..
/home/sriman:$
|-guarage
	|-spares
	|-tools
		|-heavy
		|-regular
			|-spec.txt
we want to delete tools directory?
cd guarage/tools/regular
rm spec.txt
cd ..
rmdir regular
rmdir heavy
cd ..
rmdir tools

#2. 
Instead of deleting subdirecties to delete a parent we can use
rm -r directoryName 
here -r stands for recursively delete files/directories inside the given directory
