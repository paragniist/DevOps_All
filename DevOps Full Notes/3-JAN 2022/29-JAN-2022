How to move files or directories into another location?
1. how to move a file from source location to destination directory?
/home/sriman:$
library

/home/sriman:$ mv library/novels/greatsaints.txt societylibrary/

3. How to rename a file?
/home/sriman:$ greatstories.txt

For renaming the filename there is no rename command, the mv command only works.
	
mv sourceFile dir/ = moves the file from source to destination
mv sourceFile newFileName = if provide 2nd argument as new filename rather than directory/, mv renames the file
mv dir1 dir2 = if the 2nd directory provide is non-existent, it renames the dir1 to dir2

/home/sriman:$ mv greatstories.txt indianleaders.txt

|-home/sriman:$
	|-humpty.txt
	|-library
		|-kids
			
How to copy humpty.txt into library/kids/ with filename as kidsstories.txt

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In windows when we are creating the files, along with filename we provide extension to the file of 3 characters as filename.ext
for eg..
accounts.txt
aadhar.pdf
balance-sheet.xls
etc

The windows operating system/programs running on windows relies on these extensions to identify the type of contents inside the file. So that operation system can associate a relevant program to handle the file which is called "File associations"
For eg.. when we double-click on pdf file, automatically operating system opens it in pdf support programs, os determines which program to be used to handle/process the file based on extension.
	
Linux operating system, the file extensions are not required, because linux doesnt uses file extensions to determine the type of the file. It uses the contents/data inside the file to identify which type of file it is.
	
But how does an linux user can identify the file is of which type since there is no extension for the file.
We can use a shell command file filename to identify the type of the file.
	
file filename
displays the type of the file.
