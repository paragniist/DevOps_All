What is the structure of a Bash command?
There are total 3 parts are there in Bash command
1. command = the action or the operation we wanted to perform

2. options = options are used for changing the behaviour of the command. options are optional to be used as apart of the command, and we pass option using -option. Here "-" helps to distinguish between option and argument. If we use -value the command treats it as option.
	
3. arguments = is the input passed to the command asking to use for performing the operation

command [option] [arguments]

1. How to remove a file?

2. How to remove a special file?

3. How to remove/delete a directory?
There are 2 ways are there
	1. empty the directory contents and delete the directory using rmdir
	rmdir directoryName
	2. delete directory and its contents recursively using
	rm -r directoryName
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. How to write a message to the STDOUT or terminal?
echo "message"	
	
2. How to create a file with data inside it?

Every bash command, takes the input from STDIN and writes the output to STDOUT. if we want we can redirect the input/output of the commands using redirection operations described below.
There are 2 types of redirection operators are there
1. input redirector = using which we can redirect the input source from where program takes the input. Input redirection can be done using "<"
2. output redirector = we want redirect output of a command to a destination. Output redirection can be done using ">"	
Now we can use every bash command with either input/output redirection depends on the command we are using.
	
echo "data" > filename


3. How to see the contents of a File?
cat filename
displays the contents of the file

cat < filename = takes the input from File and writes the contents of the file to STDOUT
cat filename
both the above commands are same, because we are passing argument as input asking to the cat to read the file
cat = take the input from keyboard and writes the output to STDOUT
cat > news.txt

There are 2 ways we create a file with data
1. echo "data" > filename = here the message/data we supplied will be written onto the File
2. cat > filename  = it reads the data from keyboard interactively and writes to the File until we press ctrl + D

#2 copy and move commands

#2.1 cp 
cp stands for copy and is used for copying the files/folders into a different location. the original files/folders will not be modified/moved when we use cp

How to copy a File?
/home/sriman:$
payslip.txt
/home/sriman:$
|-backup
syntax:-
cp filename destinationlocation/
cp payslip.txt backup

How to copy the directory into another location?
/home/sriman:$
|-library
  |-novels
		|-kecret.txt
		|-shakespear.txt
	|-kids
		|-fun.txt
		|-logicmaths.txt
	|-topsellers	
		
want to copy the novels directory into topsellers directory
cp only copies a file from one location to another location. if we want to copy directory and its contents into a different location we need to use -R (recursively)
	
cp -R library/novels/ library/topsellers/ = which means recursively copy along with directory its files/sub directories also under the destination

How to copy the contents of the directory into another directory?
/home/sriman:$	
library/
├── kids
│   └── funmaths.txt
├── novels
│   ├── 3idiots.txt
│   └── indiansaints.txt
    
└── topsellers	

cp library/novels/* library/topsellers = copy all the files of a folder into destination
cp -R library/novels/* library/topsellers = if novels has subdirectories then we need to -R
