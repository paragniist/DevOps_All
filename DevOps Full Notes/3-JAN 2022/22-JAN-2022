#1. through virtualization software
Minimum System Requirement
operating system: windows and mac
cpu: i3, i5, i7, ryzon or amd (equivalent to i3 or above)
ram: 8gb
hdd space: 20 gb (free space)

#2. through aws cloud ec2 compute machine (good internet connection)
	
#3 dual boot operating system if you dont qualify with minimal system requirements
