5. How does linux operating system identifies the type of an given file?
In linux operating system we dont have to create a file using extension, because linux doesnt rely on file extension to identify the type of the file, rather it uses contents of the file to determine.
If there is no extension how does the user can identify the type of file?
file filename = returns the information about the type of file.

1. How to use regular expressions in Linux shell commands?
There are 3 symbols that can be used as part linux shell commands as regular expression characters.
	1. "*" = for any characters of any number match
	2. "?" = any single character match
	3. "[]" = single character within the give group match
	
/home/sriman:$
|-products
	|-jean-pants.txt
	|-cotton-pants.txt
	|-night-pants.txt
	|-linen-pants.txt
	|-jackets.txt
	|-ucb-jackets.txt
	|-usp-jackets.txt
	|-lee-jackets.txt
	|-hrx-jackets.txt
	|-gap-jackets.txt
	|-w-jackets.txt
	
ls ~/products
ls ~/products/*-pants.txt = shows all the files which are ending with -pants.txt
ls ~/products/?????-pants.txt = shows all the files of 5 any characters ending with -pants.txt
ls ~/products/[jc]* = 
[] matching one character within range
In the above expression it matches with files which are starting with either "j" or "c"

ls -l ~/products/???-jackets.txt
give me all the jackets with are of 3 characters and 2nd position with cs and third character should be within range of [be]
ls ~/products/?[cs][be]-jackets.txt

ls -l ~/products/*j*
ls -l ~/products/u*[te]*

2. Working with ranges in shell commands?
we want to repeatedly execute a shell command over the range of values, this can be done using {}

echo 1
echo 2
echo 3
echo 4
echo 5
echo 6
echo 7
echo 8
echo 9
echo 10
or
echo {1..10} 

touch dairy1.txt
touch dairy2.txt
touch dairy3.txt
touch dairy{1..12}.txt
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. How to create an hidden file in linux operating system?
In linux if a file/folder name starts with "." it is considered as hidden file/folder and linux will not display them when we use ls command

touch .secret = .secret is the filename which is considered as hidden file
mkdir .vault = creates an hidden directory with name .vault

when we use ls command both of these will not be listed
to see all the files including the hidden files we need to -a option with ls

ls -a
here -a stands for show/list all the files
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. using more
---------------

when we are running an linux shell commands, few commands might results in large output that may not fit the screen to easily read. the contents will auto-scrolled up which makes us difficult to read the content. we need to manually scroll the page top to read.

Instead of scrolling up we can use more command as below

cat manual.txt | more
will allow to browse the output by scrolling through lines. it initially display a full page of output and waiting for scrolling line by line
press enter button will scroll through the output. press q to quit scrolling.
