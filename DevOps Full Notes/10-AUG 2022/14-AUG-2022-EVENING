automation for mysql server database

1. how to install the mysql server with our own supplied password for the root user in an non-interactive installation?
In ubuntu operating system there is a package called debconf-utils which stands for debian configuration utilities through which we can pass the input values to the package manager during the installation of the software.
	
mysql-server-8.0	mysql-server/root_password	password root	
mysql-server-8.0	mysql-server/root_password_again	password root


2. we need to launch mysql_secure_installation script for configuring the database, but the script requires interactive inputs which will breaks the touchless automation.
So how to run any shellscript non-interactively
That is where we have expect shell utility

addNumbers.sh
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter a: " A
read -p "Enter b: " B
SUM=$[A+B]
echo "SUM: $SUM"

The above shellscript we wanted to run non-interactively? 
To do that write one more shellscript that launches the above shellscript by passing inputs

nonIteractiveAddNumbers.sh
#!/usr/bin/expect -f
set timeout -1
spawn ./addNumbers.sh
expect "Enter a: "
send -- "10\r"
expect "Enter b: "
send -- "20\r"
expect eof
