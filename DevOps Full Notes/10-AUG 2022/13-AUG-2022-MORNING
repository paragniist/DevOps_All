How to create our own vagrant boxfile?

4. install open ssh server and configure vagrant insecure public key and disable passwordAuthentication
5. configure passwordless sudoers access
6. install the required softwares for running the project
7. shutdown the machine and package it as an vagrant boxfile

What are the contents of the vagrantbox file?
by default vagrant packages by compressing the virtual machine disk image file into package.box file when we run vagrant package --box "virtualmachine"

if we want to generate the boxfile with a different name we can use --output filename 
vagrant package --box "virtualmachine name" --output file.box

The vagrant boxfile contains the below list of files inside it
package.box
|-vdi
|-Vagrantfile (all the current virtual machine configurations will be exported into Vagrantfile and place in box file)
|-metadata.json

vagrant box list = show the list of boxfiles available on our local machine
vagrant box remove boxfilename = removes the boxfile from local cache
vagrant box add boxname vbox.box = adds the boxfile into local cache
