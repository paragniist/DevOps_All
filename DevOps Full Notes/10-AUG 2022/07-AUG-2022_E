Vagrant SSH
------------
What does vagrant do to provide ssh access to the virtual machine?
1. vagrant uses the vagrant boxfile to create the virtual machines, these boxfiles are prepackaged/preinstalled with 
	1.1 operating system
	1.2 preconfigured os user (vagrant/vagrant)
	1.3. pre-installed openssh server
	1.4 seeded with default public/private key to facilitate ssh access in first boot
	1.5 preconfigured with network mode: NAT with forwarded port: host: 2222, guest: 22
		
2. upon booting the virtual machine first-time vagrant ssh into the vm using predefined keys and generates a new public/private secured keys install the public_key on to the virtual machine and stores the corresponding private key on the host machine project directory .vagrant directory
3. removes the default keys from the virtual machine and make the machine ready for ssh

4. when we type vagrant ssh
it goes into the .vagrant directory of the project and picks up the private_key it has generated and ssh into the virtual machine using 2222 as forwarded port from host so internally executes the ssh command as below
ssh -i ./.vagrant/private_key -P 2222 vagrant@127.0.0.1
