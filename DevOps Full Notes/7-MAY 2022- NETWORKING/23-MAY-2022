Ip Address
-----------
For each computer on a network, to uniquely identify the computer and access it we need ip address.
There are 2 types of address are there for each computer
1. physical address = The mac address of the network interface card acts as an physical address of the computer
2. logical address = ip address that is assigned to the network interface card acts as an logic address
	
The logical address/ip address will be assigned to a computer only when it is connected to the network.
There are 2 versions of ip address are there
1. ipv4 = ipv4 address is of 32-bit in length
2. ipv6 = ipv6 address is of 128-bit in length

By using the ipv4 addressing version of 32-bit length we can connection 4.1 billion computers on the network by assigning the number to these computers.
Anything that is connected to the network should be assigned with an ip address for eg..
	1. Computer
	2. Laptop
	3. Mobile
	4. Printer
	5. Scanner
	6. Television
	7. Switch
	8. Router
anything that is connected to a network will be assigned with an ip address. so there is a high chance of we quickly running out of ip address that can be generated for a ipv4 range when more devices are connected to the network.
So to overcome the problem the ipv6 has been introduced	, the ipv6 is an 128-bit hexa decimal number that allows more number of devices to be connected to the network and looks like we can never run out of ip range.
	
All the network devices supports both ipv4 and ipv6 addressing and right now the ipv4 is in active use and future might switch to ipv6 address only
