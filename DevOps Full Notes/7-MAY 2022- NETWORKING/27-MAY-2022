What is subnet mask, why do we need it?
Within a given ip address there are 2 types of address are there
1. network address
2. host address
based on classfull ip addressing we can identify from a given ip what is the network address and host address.
	
To help us in quickly computing the network and host address from an given ip address subnet mask has been introduced
For each ip address classification, we know network bits and host bits, so based on that the subnet mask can be derived as below.
CLASS A = 255.0.0.0
CLASS B = 255.255.0.0
CLASS C = 255.255.255.0
	
now to compute network address for a given ip address
1. identify the IP CLASS of the ip address
2. choose the relevant subnet mask of that IP CLASS
3. represent both ip address and subnet mask in binary format
4. do an bit AND operation to derive the network address
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CIDR [Class-less inter-domain routing]

while we are working with classfull ip addressing the bits are evenly broken based on octets. for eg.. in CLASS A, the first 8 bits are given to network and 24 bits are given to host address.
Similarly in CLASS C, 24 bits are given to network and only 8 bits are given to host address. because of this we have an limitation described below.
	
I want to create a 2500 hosts into one network, which ip class should i choose?
Here if we use CLASS C only 8 bits are given to host, that means we can connect only 255 computers. So we can use CLASS B
16bits for network and 16 bits for host

65535 computer networks and each network can be connected with 65535 hosts

now i wanted to connect 2500 hosts in each network, wanted to create 75000 networks
2500 hosts = we need to choose CLASS B only, so 16 bits are allocated to HOST address
remaining 16 bits are assigned to network address: 65535 networks
In the above case we cannot use CLASS B or any of the classes.

Here we analyze 16 bits are given to network and 16 bits are given to host based on classification.
But to represent 2500 hosts, how many bits we need?
we only need just 12 bits, so remaining 4 bits are wasted by assigning to host adress.
if we can assign those 4 bits to network address, then we can accomplish what we wanted.
	
So we need to assign 20 bits to network address and 12 bits to host address to build the above network, which can be possible by using CIDR notation

In CIDR we dont allocate network and host bits based on IP CLASSES, we distribute network and host bits based on requirement.
Till now we are deriving network and host address based on ip classes,if there is no ip classes how do we identify for a given ip what is the network address and host address?
	
Now when we are writing an ip address in CIDR notation we need to represent the ip address as below
CIDR IP ADDRESS NOTATION: 192.168.44.28/22
