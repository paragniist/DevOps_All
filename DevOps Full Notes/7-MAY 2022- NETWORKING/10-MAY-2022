application layer:
in the application layer the application protocols are used for exchanging the data between applications which are communicating over the network

application protocols:
application protocols defines standard messaging formats and semantics so that both the applications can agree upon them in communicating over the network

There are most commonly used applications are there over the internet, the Internet Standard has identified such type applications which we commonly use as part of our day-to-day life and defined standard protocols for vendor/platform portability

For exchanging the HTML/Web pages over the network : HTTP/HTTPS protocol
[Hypertext Transfer protocol]
Server: Http/Web Server
Client: Browser
default: 80
	
For transferring files across the computers over the network: FTP protocol
[File Transfer Protocol]
Server: FTP Server
Client: FTP Client
default: 20/21
	
For email exchanges we use bunch of protocols
SMTP = Simple Mail Transfer protocol (sending/receiving) (port: 25)
POP3 = Postoffice Protocol (reading the mails) (port: 110)
IMAP = Internet Message Access Protocol (advanced multi-media email sending/receiving) (port: 143)
Server: Email Exchange Server
Client: outlook, thunderbird, lotusnotes

Remote Desktop application (RDP) for connecting computers remotely over the network:
uses RDP protocol, remote desktop application protocol
Server: Microsoft inbuilt server program (or third-party server programs are available)
Client: Windows RemoteDesktop client program 
port: 3389
	
Secure Shell (SSH): 22
used for connecting remote linux computers over the network	

when client program is trying to access the server program, the client has to use application protocol of the server in sending/receiving the data over the network and should use url for accessing
The url contains the below parts
schema://serveripaddress:port/resource
schema: protocol you are using in sending the request it can be
http or ftp or smtp or pop3 or imap etc

http://192.168.10.11/index.html (this request by default will be sent to the server program running on port 80, since we specified schema as "http")
