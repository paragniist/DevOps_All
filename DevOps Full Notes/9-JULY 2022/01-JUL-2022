Java Language
-------------
What is an programming language, what the purpose of it?
programming language provides programmatic constructs/instructions using which we can write programs for performing operations.
There are 2 types of programming languages are there
1. low-level programming languages
Low-level programming language programs directly works on the underlying operating system of the computer. These language programs doesnt require any translation/compilation for execution.
For eg.. shellscripting 

advantages:-
	1. These programs are hardware portable and works across any underlying hardware vendors
	2. high performance, since these programs are already written in operating system instructionset they dont need translation during execution
	3. as these works closely with underlying operating system, there are powerful enough to use the platform services
	
dis-advantages:-
	1. Platform dependent, these are not platform (operating system) portable
	2. quite complex to program and maintain
	
2. high-level programming languages
