High-level programming language
High-level programming languages provides their own instructionset which is operating system independent instruction set. The programmer has to write software programs using HLL instructionset 
advantage:-
	1. These are english like language simple to understand and easy to learn
	2. The syntaxes are developer friendly
	3. portable across the operating platform
	4. write-once run on any platform
	
dis-advantage:-
	1. few of the instructionset supported by the High-level languages are operating system platform specific instructionset and may not be portable across the platforms.	
	2. developers has to spend lot of time in achieving platform portability in developing the applications
	3. The developer has to take extensive care while developing the program and perform unit testing to ensure the code he has written s working across all the platforms.
	4. The qa engineers has to setup different environments and certify the application is working across all the platforms
		- the time required for certifying the program is working across all the platforms
		- the cost incurred for testing the application
		- the delivery time required in delivering the application is quite high
	5. we need to build,maintain and distribute different copies of the binaries of the application each per platform to release it to the customers/endusers of different platform
	
To overcome the problems with high-level programming languages the platform-independent high-level programming languages are introduced like
1. java
2. .net
etc
