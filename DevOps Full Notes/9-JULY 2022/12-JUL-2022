There are 2 types of jar distributions are there in java language
#1. library jar
#2. application/executable jar

#1. library jar
we can package bunch of classes into a jar packaging structure and can distribute to the other people, so that others can reuse our classes within their application

1.1 How does the jar structure looks?
jarFilename.jar
|-META-INF
	|-manifest.mf
|-packages
	|-.class
		
For eg.. we want to distribute a utility called pdfmaker with below directory structure
pdfmaker
|-com
  |-pdfmaker
		|-document
			|-*.class
upon packaging the above directory into a jar, the jar file structure looks as below.				
				
pdfmaker.jar
|-META-INF
	|-manifest.mf
|-com
  |-pdfmaker
		|-document
			|-*.class
What is Jar?
Jar is an zip archive of java language, which is equivalent to a zip file only. but the difference is
	1. the jar files are portable across the operating system platforms
	2. jar interpreter can directly execute the .class files inside the jar file, we dont need to unzip to use them
In the above jar file we have directory called "META-INF", stands for meta information which means information about the jar
it contains an manifest.mf which is called "jar descriptor" file that holds the details of the jar like, version, manufacturer and licensing details

How to package a directory of classes into a jar file?
The java has provided an jar tool/utility as part of JDK distribution, we need to use the jar tool for packaging the class files for distribution

jar -cvf file.jar directory
-c = create
-v = verbose (show me comments on the command execution)
-f = filename
