How many types of web applications are there?
There are 2 types of web applications are there
1. static web application
2. dynamic web application

#2. dynamic web application
In case of dynamic web application, the application takes the data as an input from the user/client over the network using HTTP protocol. perform operation on the data and builds a dynamic response (as a HTML) and dispatches as a response back to the client.
So per each request, the response that is returned by the application would vary or change, so it is called dynamic web application

To compute or perform operation based on the user input, we need to write programs, so always an dynamic web application is build based on a backend-language like 
- java
- .net
- php
- python
etc

To host an dynamic web application we need an dynamic webserver (based on the backend language used)
If we are using java language as a backend then we need to use one of the java language web server like
1. Tomcat
2. Weblogic Server
3. Websphere Server
4. Jboss Wildfly Server
5. Jetty
6. Netty
7. Glassfish
etc

How does the structure of an web application project looks like?
What is a war file?
war stands for web application archive, it comprises of application code, libraries and descriptor files together packaged into a war file

application code = business logic
libraries = reusable code
descriptor files = information about the classes of our application provided as an input to java web server

warfile.war
|-*.html
|-*.css
|-*.js
|-*.images
|-WEB-INF
	|-classes (application code: *.class)
	|-lib (*.jar libraries)
	|-web.xml (descriptor)
	
[standard directory structure of a web application project]	
project (directory)(git repository)
|-src
	|-*.java
|-WebContent
	|-*.html

	|-*.js
	|-WEB-INF
		|-lib
			|-*.jar
