what is the difference between scripted pipeline and declarative pipeline?
1. In declarative pipeline always the pipeline execution begins with declarative SCM checkout which comes for free, where as in scripted pipeline we need to write the checkout from scm

2. In declarative pipeline we can restart a pipeline from any stage within the pipeline where as in scripted pipeline we cannot execute the pipeline from any stage always it starts from stage 1
