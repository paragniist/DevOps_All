1. Global Scope
The services scoped to the Global are accessible and available across all the regions of the AWS Cloud platform, A change in any of these services would be reflected across all the regions of the AWS account for whom we are modifying
For eg..
1. If we add an DNS entry in Route53 Service the route information would be reflected or modified across all the regions of the aws account
2. The changes we made to the user in IAM registry would be reflected globally across all the regions of the account

2. Regional Scope
The services that are scoped to region level are only visible and accessible within that region only.
For eg.. when we create a DynamoDB table it is scoped to the region level and would be visible and accessible within that region only

If we create an S3 bucket, the bucket and objects stored inside the bucket are accessible within the region only

3. Availability Zone
These are the services created and accessible within the AZ of the region only
For e.g.. an ec2 instance will be created within the AZ of a region only
