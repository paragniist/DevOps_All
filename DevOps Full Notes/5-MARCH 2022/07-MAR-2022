By default when a user creates a file/folder in linux system, the file or folder will be associated with
owner as the user who created the file and group as the primary group of the owner who created it.
	
There are 3 levels of permissions attached to a file/folder by default
	1. owner
	2. group
	3. others
	
Types of permissions
1. Read    = r
2. Write   = w
3. Execute = x

The linux assigns default permissions to a file/folder upon creating
default permission:
         owner  group  others
file:    rw-    rw-    r--
folder:  rwx    rwx    r-x

How can we allow other users of the linux operating system to access files/folders of a user?

How to change the permissions of an existing file/folder in linux?
The sudoer/root only can change the permissions for a file/folder and linux has provided an shell command called "chmod"	
	
chmod = stands for change mode "permissions" for a file/folder
chmod supports 2 modes of changing the file permissions
1. octal mode
2. symbolic mode

#1. octal mode
in octal notation each permission has been given an weighted number
r = 4
w = 2
x = 1
	-----
	  7
	-----
7 = indicates we granted read, write and execute permission
5 = read, execute only
6 = read and write only

while working with octal notation we need to specify permissions for a given folder/file for all 3 levels of users (owner/group/others).
syntax:
sudo chmod ownergroupother file/folder

sudo chmod 764 accounts.txt
7 = owner permissions
6 = group permissions
4 = other permissions
