What are the best practices we need to follow in running an software package on linux machine?
1. For each software application/program we want to execute create an separate user
	1.1 The user we create should not be able to login into the system
	1.2 dont need to have an home directory
	1.3 should only be associated in his own group
	1.4 should not have any password
2. change ownership of the binary distribution package to the user
3. change the permission of the files/folder to 540 or 500
4. switch to the new user and launch the software package

How to run tomcat server binary distribution in linux?
1. create an user for eg.. mwuser (no home, no password) and should belong to mwuser group only
sudo useradd mwuser

2. general best practise in running the binary distributions or any software packages is.
	create an directory under "/" root called "/u01"
sudo mkdir /u01
sudo chown -R mwuser:mwuser /u01

3. under that for each software package create an directory for eg.. we want to run tomcat server, then place tomcat-server distribution directory under /u01

4. switch to mwuser
sudo su mwuser

5. download the apache-tomcat binary distribution tar.gz and place it under /u01 directory
cd /u01
wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.60/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.60.tar.gz

6. extract the apache-tomcat-9.0.60.tar.gz file
gunzip apache-tomcat-9.0.60.tar.gz
tar -xvf apache-tomcat-9.0.60.tar

7. grant execute permission to apache tomcat server ./startup.sh shutdown.sh
sudo chmod u+x apache-tomcat-9.0.60/bin/startup.sh apache-tomcat-9.0.60/bin/shutdown.sh

8. To make tomcat server launch from any directory location on our machine there are 2 ways are there
	1. add /u01/apache-tomcat-9.0.60/bin to the PATH variable by modifying ~/.bashrc
	2. create an symlink for startup.sh and shutdown.sh under /usr/bin directory

Linux Text processing Commands
-------------------------------
The text processing commands are used for taking a text of characters as an input either from the STDIN or from a file and apply actions/operations on the content like
1. searching for a given text
2. extracting the contents of the file based on delimeter
3. substituting or replacing a text
4. searching and deleting the text content
There are quite a number of linux shell utilities are available to perform the text processing as below.
	1. cut
	2. paste
	3. awk
	4. sed
	5. sort
