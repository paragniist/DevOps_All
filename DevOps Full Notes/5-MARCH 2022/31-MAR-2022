Linux text processing commands
-------------------------------
There are few text processing shell commands are there in linux through which we can perform the below operations/actions on the text content like
1. searching for a specific text in a given text of information
2. extracting a portion of data
3. extract few fields of information from given text
4. merging 2 different text content together
5. replace/substituting the text content
6. delete a portion of the text
these commands takes input data from the STDIN or file and perform the operation and provides the output
1. cut
2. paste
3. sort
4. awk
5. sed

#1.
cut = is a command that takes the data as an input from STDIN or a file breaks the data based on delimeter and extracts the fields of data and prints the output on the STDOUT by default

delimeter = means field separator
In the above file we can consider delimeter as "," which indicates field separator, so that each line as #5 fields

now we can ask cut command to delimite the fields based on "," and extract 2 field of data from the file

cut -d delimeter -f fieldNo fileName
cut -d "," -f 2 accounts.txt
cut -d "," -f 2-4 accounts.txt

here -f stands for field position

#2. paste:
-----------
paste is used for merging the contents of a 2 different files based on a delimeter

using paste we can merge contents of 2 different files line by line into onesingle output by using delimeter

paste -d delimeter file1 file2
paste -d "," players.txt players-details.txt

#3. awk
awk is an utility that is used by the programmers in performing actions or operations on the text content as 
1. print all the lines of text in a file
2. extracts the specific fields of data based on delimeter
3. filter the data based on the matching patterns
4. apply actions on the text content line by line like transformations etc

syntax:-
awk [options] 'selection-criteria {action}' file/input text

How does awk works?
when we run awk command by passing a file as an input, 
1. The awk reads the file line by line
2. it applies the selection criteria to filter the lines
3. it applies the action specified

awk has pre-defined variables to identify and process the text in a file
1. NR = represents the current row it is processing
2. NF = no of fields of the current row
3. FS = field separator and by default the field separator is "space"
4. RS = record separator and default record separator is "new line"
5. OFS = output field separator while displaying the output
6. ORS = output record separator while displaying the output
