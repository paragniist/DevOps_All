what is umask?
while creating a file/folder in linux operating system, the linux takes care of assigning the default permissions to a file/folder as most of the time we wanted the same permissions to be assigned to the files/folders we create, so to simplify the process of creating the files the default permissions are applied.

How does linux derives the default permission for a file/folder?
Linux derives the default permissions to be assigned to a file/folder using umask. umask is a special variable available per each user of the linux operating system.

The default value assigned to the umask variable is
Root User = 0002
Normal User = 0022


The default max permissions allowed:
To File of linux operating system is = 666, where the execute permission on a file will not be granted or issued by default for security
To Folder = 777, as we should be able change directory (cd) into the directory


bob
umask = 022

touch planes.txt
      666
		- 022
		------
		  644   == default permission
rw-r--r--

mkdir boxes
max default permission for folder  = 777
                                    -022
																		----
																		 755
																		 ----
rwxr-xr-x   boxes


Now while creating an file/folder linux will compute the default permissions for a file/folder by using umask variable value of that user.
Linux will takes the max default permissions of a file which is 666 and substracts with umask value of the user to derive permission for that file
 666
-022
------
 644
-------
similarly while creating an folder it substract the max default permission of a folder which is 777 with umask value of the user to derive default permissions

How to know the umask value of a user?
There is an command called umask which will displays the current user umask value
umask
displays the umask variable value of that user

we can change the default permission being assigned to a file/folder for a user by changing the default umask value of that user
umask 0ownergroupothers

when we change the umask for a user it will be temporary upon relogin/restart the umask will be reset to default 

How to permanently change the umask value for an user?
add an entry into the ~/.bashrc file as shown below to make umask permanent

vi ~/.bashrc
goto the end of the file and add an entry
umask 0026
The above umask value is applied for only the user for whom we changed

what is the reason for having different umask values for root and normal user?
always a root/super user will be created in his username/own group only, since he is the only user who exists in his group, there is no point in allocating a different permission for the group so the umask value for the user/group will be same which is = 002

whereas a normal user can be created other than the usergroup by using -g option in such case we want to differentiate file/folder permissions from owner to group so the default umask = 022
