How many levels at which we assign permissions to a file/folder in Linux?
There 3 categories into which the permissions can be assigned to a File/Folder
1. owner = The user who has created the file/folder becomes the owner
2. group = The primary group of the user who created the file/folder becomes group for that file/folder
3. others = any other linux users who are not an owner or not part of the group becomes others

There are 3 types of permissions we can assign to a File/Folder
File
1. READ    (r) = can cat the contents of the file
2. WRITE   (w) = can edit/modify the contents of the file
3. EXECUTE (x) = applicable to only program files, and given an execute permission we can run the program

Folder
1. READ    (r) = can list the contents of the directory but cannot change into the directory (cd)
2. WRITE   (w) = can add/delete/copy/move the files/folders inside the directory
3. EXECUTE (x) = can cd into the directory

By default when a user created a file/folder in linux operating system, the operating system itself will assign default permissions to a file/folder

#1. How to see the permissions assigned to a File/Folder?
ls -l
ls -l = displays long list of files/folders in a given directory along with permissions defined for those files/folders

#1 #2     #3  #4     #5      #6   #7          #8
drwxrwxr-x 2 sriman sriman  4096 Jan 28 22:23 archives
drwxrwxr-x 2 sriman sriman  4096 Feb  2 22:04 cmp
drwxrwxr-x 3 sriman sriman  4096 Jan 26 22:42 coffeeshop
drwxrwxr-x 3 sriman sriman  4096 Feb 14 22:15 compression
drwxrwxr-x 2 sriman sriman  4096 Feb 23 22:01 d1

#1 character indicates type of the File
d = directory
- = regular file
l = link file
b = block special file
c = character special
p = pipe files
s = socket file

#2 The next 9 characters defines the permissions assigned to that file/folder
1. The 3 characters defines the permissions assigned to the owner
2. The next 3 Characters for group
3. last 3 characters for others
r = read, w = write x = execute - = no permission

#3 number indicates how many hardlinks are there for that file/folder
#4 owner = user who created the file 
#5 group = group to which file is associated with
#6 size = size of the file or folder
#7 last accessed date
#8 file/folder name

How to grant access to a specific group of users of the operating system on File/Folder?
Many of the times we create linux users with primary group as username group only, in such case the access permission for the file/folder will exists only for that user since he is the only user who exists in the username group.
	
if we want to grant access permissions on a File/Folder to other users of the linux:
#1. create a group (if in case we dont have an group with users you want to share with)
#2. change the group association for that file to the newly/existing group

so that the file will be shared to group of users along with owner


#1 we have user bob who belongs to primary group as "bob" only
/home/bob$ touch machines.txt

ls -l machines.txt
-rw-rw-r--  bob  bob  

#2 if we want to share the file to other specific set of users in linux operating system, first create a group
sudo groupadd devopsgroup

#3 add the specific set of users to the devopsgroup
sudo usermod -aG joe devopsgroup
sudo usermod -aG tom devopsgroup

#4 Now change the owner/group to which the file belongs to using chown
chown = stands for change ownership of the file / folder

sudo chown user:group file/folder = change the file/folder to a specific owner and group
sudo chown bob:devopsgroup machines.txt
if we want to modify the owner/group of all the files in a directory we can use -R recursively switch
sudo chown -R owner:group folder = change owner/group for all the files/directory recursively including the specified directory
