Process Management
-------------------
What is a process?
Process is a program under execution, where operating system will creates a process for each program we asked him to execute to keep track of the information related 
	1. owner
	2. cpu
	3. memory
	4. hdd
	5. program name
	6. elasped time
of the process so that operating system can effectively allocate resource of the computer in executing/running the process
For each process the linux operating system will allocate PID (process id) to identify and manage the process. each process will be storeed in a file separately under the location /proc directory

How to find the processes that are running within the operating system?
linux has provided top shellcommand
odwa3ubuntu@sriman:$ top
top: table of process
displays all the current running process of the linux operating system in table format

PID   USER   PR  NI   VIRMEM   RESMEM   SHRMEM  %CPU  %MEM   S   TIME+COMMAND
PID     = process id
USER    = owner of the process
PR      = priority
NI      = nice value
VIRMEM  = virtual memory 
RESMEM  = reserved memory
SHRMEM  = shared memory
%CPU    = cpu usage
%MEM    = memory usage
S       = status of the process
TIME+
COMMAND = elasped time + program used for lauching the process

What are the possible status in which a process can be there in linux operating system?
There are 6 status in which a process could exist in linux system
1. D = daemon / un-interruptable process
2. S = sleeping
3. T = traced/terminated
4. R = running
5. I = idle
6. Z = zoombie
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How does the linux operating system allocates the cpu to the processes?
Linux operating system is an multi-user and multi-programming operating system, so it allocates the cpu to multiple processes using cpu scheduling algorithms

Linux uses an hybrid model in allocating the cpu, both round robin, time sharing + priority based scheduling

Each process in linux operating system will be created with priority, the lowest the priority value of a process indicates highest priority for the process. based on the priority the cpu will be allocated to the process

There are 2 types of process are there in linux
1. system process = These process are launched and managed by the linux operating system itself and those are mostly daemons

2. user process = These the programs that are fed as an input to linux operating system asking to execute which are called "user process"
	
A process can be assigned with a priority ranging between 0 - 139, where 0 - 99 system process space which we cannot modify. and the user process are allocated with the priority between 100 - 139
by default linux process will be created with a default PR = 120	
	
Can we change the priority of the process?
Linux doesnt permit us to directly change the priorty of a process, if it allows the user to directly change the priority of the process then a user can assign the priority of a user process overriding the system process space, which will leads to un-expected behaviour

So linux allows the user to change the priority of the user process in a controlled way using nice value. The priority of the process will be computed based on the nice value

PR = 20 + NICE_VALUE
the valid range of the nice value can exists between -20 to 19
	
PR = 20 + (-20) = 100
	 = 20 + (19)  = 39
The highest the nice value of a process, the lowest the priority of a process.
	
How to change the priority of a process?
renice -n nicevalue pid - to change the priority of an existing process
renice = is used for changing the priority of an existing process

we can launch a process with a specific priority using nice
nice -n nicevalue command

by default a process will be launched with default nice value : 20, we can decrease the priority of the process by increasing the  nice value.
but we cannot increase the priority of the process by decreasing the nice value unless you are a sudoer


How to stop a running process?
using kill we can stop a running process
sudo kill -9 pid
